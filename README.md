# Professional README Generator
  
## As a developer, I want to create a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project. In this project, I need to create a professional README generator that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When prompted for information about my application repository, a high quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
  2. The project title entered when prompted, is displayed as the title of the README.
  3. The description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions entered when prompted, is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
  4. The license chosen from a list of options when prompted, is added as a badge near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
  5. The GitHub username entered is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
  6. The email address entered when prompted is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
  7. The table of contents has links that will take you to the corresponding section of the README.


The following link is a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functioanlity of the README generator.
